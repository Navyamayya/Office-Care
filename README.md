#  Project Design
A pictorial representory is attached in repository
1.	Automatic Welcome Gate
      Welcome gate is the glass door in the entrance of the office. When a person approaches the door, it opens automatically and as a sign of Welcoming it prints a ‘’Welcome’’         message in LCD simultaneously. 
2.	Sanitizing Area- (Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser)
      Sanitizing Area consists an Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser. When the person stretches their hands towards the dispenser, it dispenses the liquid as well as it prints a             message in LCD. After dispensing it gives few seconds for them to rub the liquid well on their hands. 
3.	Automatic Pass Gate
      After giving enough time to sanitize, Pass Gate will be opened for 3 secs and denotes it by blinking green LED thrice as well as prints a message in LCD Display
      simultaneously. And then with a long beep sound the red light turns on denoting the closure of gate.
